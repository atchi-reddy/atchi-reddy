  <h1>ðŸ“– About Me ðŸ“š</h1>
  

"I have a deep passion for reading. When I'm not engrossed in data analysis and algorithm tinkering, you'll often find me with a book in hand, lost in the pages of captivating stories. Whether I'm exploring Middle Earth, Hogwarts, Westeros, or distant galaxies, reading is my escape and my greatest joy."</p>
  <p>ðŸ¦… As C.S. Lewis once said, "You can never get a cup of tea large enough or a book long enough to suit me."  </p>
